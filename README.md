 # **Re-ini-mator:** 
Tool for easy .ini files merging

 ---

### Why? Oh my god, WHY?!
After all the hard work on your old laptop :shit: which throttle like a Magikarp running MS Office 10, you finally mastered basic knowledge of al-mighty programming language of your choice. \
Now you can save up for a new PC and, maybe after half a year, buy one! **Wow, AMAZING!** \
\
Yeah, nothing gonna stop you on your crazy quest to play every last video game that you've craved for the last 7 years of adulthood! \
So you've just finished Nightmare run of the **Doom 2016** :feelsgood: and now wondering what to play next? :milky_way: \
No worries, 'ma man! Just re-install **Skyrim** but with a ton of mods! :+1: Just like in good 'ol days. \
Sure, now you can pimp it a notch with all those GRAPHICAL mods! \
\
Aw, snap! We need to throw an EMB there also. But how da f' you are applying presets?... :scroll:
